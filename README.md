# Fundapps Courier Kata
_Author: Andy Davies._

#### Steps to use:
1. Clone Repo.
2. Open in Visual Studio.
3. Find Entrypoint: ParcelCostCalculator.cs "GetCourierOrderSummary" method.
4. Run tests in solution / browse in solution explorer.

#### Points of interest
* I ran out of time to attempt step (5)! Sorry!.
* Although the test said max 2 hours - I think I probably spent about 4.
* Pure TDD was not used in this case, I wrote the tests as I built new functionality.
  * I will admit I do have a lack of experience with TDD in the real world, so given the time constraints I decided I was better to use my normal/preferred workflow.
  * However given more opportunity would definitely be open to trying more pure TDD workflow.
* Not very happy with ParcelCreator.GetValidParcelSizes method... if I had more time I would look at options to refactor this to reduce conditional if/else code there.
